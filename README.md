## Activity 6 
The UI goes from unsusable to usable with the implemented CSS changes. In my opinion, the main one being border additions. By sectioning the different functional aspects of the application, and bordering different types of information, the content on the site becomes readable and organized. Otherwise, text boxes, functionalites and sections aren't spaced or clear in their purpose - everything previously looked like a single block.
